        <h4>The Importance of Being Earnest
            A Trivial Comedy for Serious People</h4>
            <h5>Algernon Moncrieff’s Flat in Half-Moon Street, W.</h5>
            ALGERNON.
            [Inspects them, takes two, and sits down on the sofa.] Oh! . . . by the
            way, Lane, I see from your book that on Thursday night, when Lord
            Shoreman and Mr. Worthing were dining with me, eight bottles of
            champagne are entered as having been consumed.</br>
            
            LANE.</br>
            Yes, sir; eight bottles and a pint.</br>
            
            ALGERNON.</br>
            Why is it that at a bachelor’s establishment the servants invariably</br>
            drink the champagne? I ask merely for information.</br>
            
            LANE.</br>
            I attribute it to the superior quality of the wine, sir. I have often</br>
            observed that in married households the champagne is rarely of a</br>
            first-rate brand.</br>
            
            ALGERNON.</br>
            Good heavens! Is marriage so demoralising as that?</br>
            
            LANE.</br>
            I believe it _is_ a very pleasant state, sir. I have had very little</br>
            experience of it myself up to the present. I have only been married</br>
            once. That was in consequence of a misunderstanding between myself and</br>
            a young person.</br>
            
            ALGERNON.</br>
            [Languidly_._] I don’t know that I am much interested in your family</br>
            life, Lane.</br>
            
            LANE.</br>
            No, sir; it is not a very interesting subject. I never think of it</br>
            myself.</br>
            
            ALGERNON.</br>
            Very natural, I am sure. That will do, Lane, thank you.</br>
            
            LANE.</br>
            Thank you, sir. [Lane goes out.]</br>
            
            ALGERNON.</br>
            Lane’s views on marriage seem somewhat lax. Really, if the lower orders</br>
            don’t set us a good example, what on earth is the use of them? They</br>
            seem, as a class, to have absolutely no sense of moral responsibility.</br>
            
            [Enter Lane.]</br>
            
            LANE.</br>
            Mr. Ernest Worthing.</br>
            
            [Enter Jack.]</br>
            
            [Lane goes out_._]</br>
            
            ALGERNON.</br>
            How are you, my dear Ernest? What brings you up to town?</br>
            
            JACK.</br>
            Oh, pleasure, pleasure! What else should bring one anywhere? Eating as</br>
            usual, I see, Algy!</br>
            
            ALGERNON.</br>
            [Stiffly_._] I believe it is customary in good society to take some</br>
            slight refreshment at five o’clock. Where have you been since last</br>
            Thursday?</br>
            
            JACK.</br>
            [Sitting down on the sofa.] In the country.</br>
            
            ALGERNON.</br>
            What on earth do you do there?</br>
